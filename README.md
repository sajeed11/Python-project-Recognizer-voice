Simple project with python language to recognizing the voice with some order you can do it, like : start music and send email... 

It's a simple code to make edit to it, like adding some new order and some speaking with the recognizer voice.For the interface I konw it's bad cuz I'm bignner with that stuff espicially Tkinter but I tried to make easier methods to give the app yiur informations to make some order.

That code it's based from Vosk package recognition offline mode API.So thanks to them a lot :)
